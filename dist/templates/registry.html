        <div id='reg-break-text' class='mobile-text-enlarge'> We are so thrilled to have you join our celebration! As many of you know, we have
            been building our lives together over the last 9.5 years including our shared home over the last 6. We are
            blessed to have a home that is already pieced together with everything we could ever need. We would always
            rather see your smiling face at the BBQ, but we’ve setup a registry for those that have expressed interest
            in offering a more traditional gift; and because we can’t ever do something perfectly conventional, we’ve
            set up a traditional registry through Amazon and a Honeymoon registry. </div>
