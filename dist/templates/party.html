                            The quickest route to Boulder is via the tollway E-470. Alternatively, you can take the

                            route: Exit DIA on Pena Boulevard. Continue until you reach I-70 West. Take I-70 West to

                    We hope you'll be able to join us for a BBQ to celebrate our marriage! Come eat, drink, be merry
                    and
                    enjoy some good company. We do want to stress that this is not a wedding, though. There's no aisle,
                    no
                    bouquet, and we fully anticipate that we'll have left our something borrowed back in Iceland (sorry

                    perfect chance.

                    Boulder has quickly become a major destination for food and drink enthusiasts (but who isn‚Äôt into
                    food
                    and drink?). If you‚Äôre in Downtown Boulder you have to check-out WestEnd Tavern or Pizzeria Locale.
                    Of
                    course, you can also explore some awesome sushi at Sushi Zanmai or Mexican at Centro.

                    Pine, Sanita‚Äôs, or Rayback Collective.

                    And don‚Äôt forget about Denver! Checking out Larimer Square, Milk Market, or the 16th Street Mall
                    will
                    offer you an array of eateries and shops.

                    Boulder can boast more than 45,000 acres of open space including multitudes of trails and parks
                    available to all! You must checkout Chautauqua Park if you see anything, but Luke and I also
                    encourage
                    you to take Broadway Street up North to visit Lyons, Estes Park, or even Rocky Mountain National
                    Park.
                    There‚Äôs nothing like driving around these breathtaking towns and beautiful mountains with the
