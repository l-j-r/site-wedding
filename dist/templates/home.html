                        <p>We’re doing things a little different, we know. When it finally came time to start planning this shindig we talked all about what we wanted this celebration to look like and what was most important to us. We ultimately decided that this is a milestone we really wanted to write in stone just the two of us. It was important to us that the entirety of the day was centered around the very simple fact that we are crazy in love and want to treat our marriage and wedding like the adventure it is. So Iceland here we come!</p>

                        <p>But of course, we are immensely blessed to be surrounded by the most supportive and loving family and friends, so we don’t want to leave y’all completely out! Although no one will be there for when we say “I Do”, we would absolutely love it if you could join us on Saturday, June 8th, 2019 to toast, cheers, dance, and be merry with us!</p>
